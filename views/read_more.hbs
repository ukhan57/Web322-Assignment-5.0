                Anime refers to animation originating from Japan, characterized
                by a unique art style that emphasizes artistic detail and camera
                effect. Anime include television series, films, OVAs, and web
                series. This is list of top 5 greatest anime I have ever

                Death Note is a Japanese television drama anime series based on
                the manga series of the same name by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi
                Obata. The show is centered around Light Yagami - a promising
                highschooler and aspiring detective with a strong sense of
                "justice".

                "It the most amazing anime I've ever seen. It was a thrilling
                and amazing experience to watch this anime series. The ending
                was fitting to the characters, especially Yagami light. At the
                same time, it was sad to see the end of the main protagonist
                dying at such young age by having no one by his side. Another
                interesting and heart throbbing character was the L, his skills
                as the detective was topnotch. The lesson of the series is well
                conveyed, no matter how much injustice is in the society we
                can't take the law in our hands."

                Attack on Titan, also known as Shingeki no Kyojin in Japanese,
                created by Hajime Isayama, is one of the most popular Japanese
                anime series to be released. It was first watched in Japan
                during 2013 and was dubbed in English to be watched in America
                in 2014. It is best known for its emotional moments, apocalyptic

                since FMA Brotherhood. Not to mention the plot, which is really
                something else. It is so well made that we instantly get into
                the "apocalyptic-kind" atmosphere, which is as well embodied by
                all the characters. I highly recommend this one."

                Naruto is an anime and manga franchise Naruto, created by
                Masashi Kishimoto. The manga was later adapted into a television
                anime, which was produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex. It
                premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo and other TX
                Network stations on October 3, 2002. The first series lasted 220
                episodes, while Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original
                series, has been airing since February 15, 2007. In addition to
                the anime series, Studio Pierrot has developed eleven movies and
                several original video animations. Other types of merchandise
                include light novels, video games, and trading cards developed
                by several companies.

                "I always say Naruto will be my favorite anime simply because it
                was the first anime I ever fell in love with. But that's not the
                only reason I think it's the best anime out there! Anyone who
                says Naruto is boring, long, too complicated, stupid or not
                worth watching obviously hasn't seen enough of it to actually
                make a legit judgement. Nobody can watch Naruto without relating
                to a character's feelings or getting tied into the emotional
                experiences. Naruto touches on key subjects like friendship,
                enduring loneliness and pain, teamwork and the will to never
                give up. The storyline is brilliantly thought up and has
                everything an anime needs. Its comedy and silliness brings
                laughter, but its sad, emotional scenes when the time is right
                can bring tears. Naruto truly is an amazing anime in itself."

                One-Punch Man combines knee-slapping comedy with the
                action-packed battles that define shonen anime. The series
                follows Saitama, an average guy who wants to become a hero. It's
                a pretty standard premise, but Saitama turned himself into one
                of the most overpowered characters of all time after three years
                of training that also resulted in total hair loss. Saitama
                became so powerful that he could defeat all of his enemies with
                a single punch, earning him the titular nickname, "One-Punch
                Man." Unfortunately, Saitama becomes bored since it's so easy
                for him to defeat anyone in a battle. One day, he meets Genos, a
                teenage cyborg who wants to become Saitama's underling. The two
                join the Hero Association, and the rest is history.

                        I would recommend people to watch Assassination
                        classroom as well since it has a very good story along
                        with fights, comedy, drama. its a must watch from me :)

                    Monster is incredible, wish it was more widely available so
                    people could watch it.

              Personal experience of watching anime.

              In my life up until this point I have successfully completed upto
              192 animes which includes multiple genres such as action,
              thriller, comedy, romance, slice of life. It started when I first
              came across Naruto in my childhood. For some reason I use to
              relate to the anime and mainly the characters which not only
              helped me mature, but look at the world in a different way and I
              am happy that I came across them.
